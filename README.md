## [GraphHopper](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper)
GraphHopper is a fast and memory-efficient routing engine released under Apache License 2.0. It can be used as a <br>
Java library or standalone web server to calculate the distance, time, turn-by-turn instructions and many road <br> 
attributes for a route between two or more points. Beyond this "A-to-B" routing it supports "snap to road", Isochrone <br>
calculation, mobile navigation and more. GraphHopper uses OpenStreetMap and GTFS data by default and it can <br>
import other data sources too.
